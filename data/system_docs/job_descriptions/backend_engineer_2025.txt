Job Description - Product Engineer (Backend)
Rakamin 2025

About the Job
You'll be building new product features alongside a frontend engineer and product manager using our Agile methodology, as well as addressing issues to ensure our apps are robust and our codebase is clean. As a Product Engineer, you'll write clean, efficient code to enhance our product's codebase in meaningful ways.

In addition to classic backend work, this role also touches on building AI-powered systems, where you'll design and orchestrate how large language models (LLMs) integrate into Rakamin's product ecosystem.

Key Responsibilities:
• Collaborating with frontend engineers and 3rd parties to build robust backend solutions that support highly configurable platforms and cross-platform integration.
• Developing and maintaining server-side logic for central database, ensuring high performance throughput and response time.
• Designing and fine-tuning AI prompts that align with product requirements and user contexts.
• Building LLM chaining flows, where the output from one model is reliably passed to and enriched by another.
• Implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by embedding and retrieving context from vector databases, then injecting it into AI prompts to improve accuracy and relevance.
• Handling long-running AI processes gracefully — including job orchestration, async background workers, and retry mechanisms.
• Designing safeguards for uncontrolled scenarios: managing failure cases from 3rd party APIs and mitigating the randomness/nondeterminism of LLM outputs.
• Leveraging AI tools and workflows to increase team productivity (e.g., AI-assisted code generation, automated QA, internal bots).
• Writing reusable, testable, and efficient code to improve the functionality of our existing systems.
• Strengthening our test coverage with RSpec to build robust and reliable web apps.
• Conducting full product lifecycles, from idea generation to design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
• Providing input on technical feasibility, timelines, and potential product trade-offs, working with business divisions.
• Actively engaging with users and stakeholders to understand their needs and translate them into backend and AI-driven improvements.

Required Skills and Experience:
• Strong track record of working on backend technologies of web apps
• Experience with backend languages and frameworks (Node.js, Django, Rails)
• Database management (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
• RESTful APIs
• Security compliance
• Cloud technologies (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
• Server-side languages (Java, Python, Ruby, or JavaScript)
• Understanding of frontend technologies
• User authentication and authorization between multiple systems, servers, and environments
• Scalable application design principles
• Creating database schemas that represent and support business processes
• Implementing automated testing platforms and unit tests
• Familiarity with LLM APIs, embeddings, vector databases and prompt design best practices
• Exposure to AI/LLM development or strong desire to learn

We're not big on credentials, so a Computer Science degree or graduating from a prestigious university isn't something we emphasize. We care about what you can do and how you do it, not how you got here.

Benefits & Perks:
• Paid time off: 17 days of vacation and personal days
• Learning benefits worth Rp29 million per year
• Device ownership: Rp7 million budget per year for productivity devices

This is a remote job. You're free to work where you work best. Looking for people based in Indonesia to ensure time zone overlap.
